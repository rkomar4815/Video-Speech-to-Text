# Video-Speech-to-Text

Let's say you're an analyst at Big Tech Companyâ„¢ and the CEO wants to know what Tech reviewers on Youtube think of the company's latest laptop. You could manually watch every laptop review on YouTube and write a report, but that takes a long time. If there were 100 15-minute review vidoes, you'd have to spend a full 25 hours watching videos.

That's not realistic. Instead, let's use this program to convert the videos into a transcript. That way you'd be able to simply read transcripts for each video and save countless hours.
